**iTunes now has built in support for mediakeys when minimized. Only use this if you need to use keys other than the default multimedia keys.**


HKTunes is an open source program that allows you to control iTunes using global hotkeys. For example, you could change the track and music volume while playing a game. It has a tray menu and a GUI to let you select hotkeys.
